# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 7, 6/21/2022
**Today's Progress**: I created Instagram for 100 days of code challenge to post my progress. Today is Day 7, and I wanted to start recording my progress on a log and practice what I've previously learned

**Thoughts**: I have been focusing on learning Python since I learned a bit of JavaScript, CSS, HTML from CSULB 1 month long bootcamp.  I started my lessons on Code Academy, and wanted to be part of a community and see how others were doing with their journey.  I feel like coding makes a lot of sense to me, I enjoy it and appreciate it.

### Day 8, 6/22/2022 
**Today's Progress**: Learning about Python Functions.  Keeping in mind that I already have learned functions and the basics of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  Strings, imports, parameters, all the basics of functions in 19 pages of lessons

**Thoughts**: Today i'm a bit distracted, stayed on the computer from 4:30pm to 12:30am just to code and learn last night.  Didn't sleep well last night from over-thinking and drinking an energy drink.  Caffeine-sensitive and all.  It's taking a while for me to get through today's lessons since I'm distracted.

### Day 9, 6/23/2022, 
**Today's Progress**: practicing functions still, putting it into one giant practice. AS well as learning Lists

**Thoughts**: A thought everyone has "the solution vs my code are exactly the same.. why isn't it working.. jk there was a space in front of def." appending and slicing lists aren't too difficult of a concept to grasp either.  I'm a bit bored, but I know that I need to learn/practice.

### Day 10, 6/24/2022 
**Today's Progress**: Using lists on python, learning inserts/index, "for loop", dictionaries/keys, 

**Thoughts**: I am extremely caffeine sensitive. Super jittery from drinking a celsius "peach vibe".  Bright side, getting A LOT of coding done. Downside, ADD is VERY high. Getting distracted super easily.

### Day 11, 6/27/2022 
**Today's Progress**: review for loops today, created repo for codeacademy project starting with A Day in Supermarket, did challenge code to find student grade/class average and used lists, dictionaries, for loop, function in a funciton etc etc.,

**Thoughts**: big weekend, eyes hurt from staring at screen, super sleepy/groggy, can't think or make any functions work today. indentations are super important cuz all of my written code is correct except for the indentations lol.  Should've started my repo for codeacadmey when i first started so that it'll display everything i've done in the past 11 days.  Better late than never

### Day 12, 6/28/2022
**Today's Progress**: lists, reviewing, and expanding on functions

**Thoughts**: not super focused, took me too long within the hour to get through 12 pages out of 18 pages in a less

### Day 13, 6/29/2022
**Today's Progress**: lists, expanding on iterating/ passing range into a function, using strings in functions, using 2 lists as 2 arguments in a function, and using a list of lists in a function

**Thoughts**: everything was pretty simple, except when i was using a list of lists in a function,  i didnt' quite figure out append. i wrote the function but forgot to include n in append.  i think i got the hang of most of it, hopefully i can translate this into something that pops out of my head.  i hope i dont need these tutorials to tell me exactly what to write.  i'm using handicap to help step by step on what to write, but i think i can actually do it (if i can understand what the final goal is needed)

### Day 15, 7/5/2022, 
**Today's Progress**: practicing battleship. use if loops, functions, and setting up battle grid.

**Thoughts**: still practicing battleship, i'm very tired from my long fishing/camping/hiking weekend in mammoth.  my brain can't focus very well.

### Day 16, 7/6/2022 
**Today's Progress**: working on battleship again. finishing up the basic game with ending the game, stopping the game when battleship is sunk, and adding 4 guessing turns

**Thoughts**: fun, hard to get into at first and to wrap my head round. but i finished it.  with extra goals

### Day 17, 7/8/2022 
**Today's Progress**: while loops

**Thoughts**: came back from a weekend trip, im burnt out and my brain is shut off. i did some but not as much as id like

### Day 19, 7/13/2022 
**Today's Progress**: finished off the while loops, took.. "a while" lol

**Thoughts**: still burnt out and my brain was weird.  glad i finished, but i think i need to figure out how to be more productive -earlier-

### Day 20, 7/14/2022 
**Today's Progress**: practice practice practice, worked with integers, summing integers, and a little on factorials

**Thoughts**: wow, i have no idea what i'm doing. this is all new information, how is this just practice? not sure if i'm getting this properly. will have to do it when i'm more awake

### Day 21, 7/18/2022
**Today's Progress**: practice practice practice,  a lot of stuff i didn't learn and unsure of what to do. 

**Thoughts**: wonder if i should do 50% of pro package to learn the parts i missed

### Day 23, 8/3/2022

### Day 25, 8/9/2022
**Today's Progress**: trying to get as much python in as possible

**Thoughts**: please save lol , this pro course makes more sense and is up to date compared to python 2.  guess i'll have to purchase the pro membership
